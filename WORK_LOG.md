While we didn't make much progress, our algorithm would probably take on the order of n squared, we did make great progress in actually understanding the question. |
| October 11 | 11:07 - 11:37 | I came up with an algorithm I think works last night. Every time the start letter is found, you start a new sequence and store the length of that sequence as an integer in an arraylist. Then, for the next character, you iterate through the sequences, adding a character if the next character in the sequence is the correct character in the sub sequence. When an incorrect character is met, you cut off that sequence and return the length of the sequence divided (integer division) by the length of the target sequence and compare it to the longest sequence before it. I started to implement this solution but am running into errors with every case but the test basic. |

It only doesn't work for the CAG test in testMore and the chromosone_22 test cases. I'm really not sure why, my theory is that it has something to do with the sequence still existing at the end of the loop and not being properly counted but I really don't know. |

I realized that the issue my code wasn't running for testlargest was because it was creating a new sequence every single time it saw the start letter, an a, so it was creating and iterating through millions, and eventually billions of arrays. i fixed this issue by adding a check if a sequence would contain the one to be added and if so, not adding it. While the code doesn't run testLargest within time yet, it is only a second or two over and I think I can get it to work. |
