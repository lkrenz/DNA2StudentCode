While we didn't make much progress, our algorithm would probably take on the order of n squared, we did make great progress in actually understanding the question. |
| October 11 | 11:07 - 11:37 | I came up with an algorithm I think works last night. Every time the start letter is found, you start a new sequence and store the length of that sequence as an integer in an arraylist. Then, for the next character, you iterate through the sequences, adding a character if the next character in the sequence is the correct character in the sub sequence. When an incorrect character is met, you cut off that sequence and return the length of the sequence divided (integer division) by the length of the target sequence and compare it to the longest sequence before it. I started to implement this solution but am running into errors with every case but the test basic. |
