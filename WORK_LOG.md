While we didn't make much progress, our algorithm would probably take on the order of n squared, we did make great progress in actually understanding the question. |
| October 11 | 11:07 - 11:37  |                                               I came up with an algorithm I think works last night. Every time the start letter is found, you start a new sequence and store the length of that sequence as an integer in an arraylist. Then, for the next character, you iterate through the sequences, adding a character if the next character in the sequence is the correct character in the sub sequence. When an incorrect character is met, you cut off that sequence and return the length of the sequence divided (integer division) by the length of the target sequence and compare it to the longest sequence before it. I started to implement this solution but am running into errors with every case but the test basic. |

It only doesn't work for the CAG test in testMore and the chromosone_22 test cases. I'm really not sure why, my theory is that it has something to do with the sequence still existing at the end of the loop and not being properly counted but I really don't know. |

I realized that the issue my code wasn't running for testlargest was because it was creating a new sequence every single time it saw the start letter, an a, so it was creating and iterating through millions, and eventually billions of arrays. i fixed this issue by adding a check if a sequence would contain the one to be added and if so, not adding it. While the code doesn't run testLargest within time yet, it is only a second or two over and I think I can get it to work. |

I got it to within a second of working for the testLargest case on my laptop. It runs sometimes, but it's essentially a roll of the dice whether it will work each time. The main way I tried to speed it up was finding repeated lookups like sequences.get(j) and replacing them with a variable. This got me from around 24 seconds to less than 20, but there has to be other ways I could speed up the code. I will keep trying in my next session. |
| October 13 | 8:55 am - 9:25 | I'm really grasping at straws to speed this algorithm up. I did some research and string.charAt() uses an internal array and calls the index so I just converted the STR string into an array of chars and used that to speed up comparisons throughout the algorithm. The next thing I might try is to somehow speed up the arraylist.remove(index) function by using an array. Arraylist.remove(index) is a linear time operation, which is certainly slowing down my code, so if I can find a way around that, I'm pretty confident my code will run fast enough. Also, testLargest() runs if I don't run testChromosone22() right before it, I think it has something to do with the excessive use of memory slowing down operations. |

I got the basic structure for the code done, with the for loop and check statements, but I need to add index out of bounds checks and debug. |
